            </ul>

            <blockquote>
               For me, one of the most important feature of .NET 7 is the release of Entity Framework 7
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                EF Core 7 is the successor to EF Core 6, and can be referred as EF7 for brevity.
                EF7 contains many new features (167 enhancements and new features, both large and small, and 171 bug
                fixes !)
            </p>

            <ul class="yx-npq yx-nde">
                <li>JSON Columns.</li>
                <li>Bulk updates and deletes.</li>
                <li>Faster SaveChanges.</li>
                <li>Custom Database First templates (with T4 templates).</li>
                <li>Stored procedure mapping for insert/update/delete.</li>
                <li>New and improved interceptors and events.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>EF7 contains also a lot of smaller enhancements you can see <a
                    href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ef7/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            <p>
                One of the major enhancements in EF Core 7 is the addition of JSON Columns, which allows for more
                efficient storage and retrieval of JSON data. Additionally, bulk updates and deletes have been included,
                making it easier to perform these operations on large sets of data.
            <blockquote>
                One of the most valuable new features in EF Core 7 for me personally is the ability to perform bulk
                updates and deletes. This allows me to eliminate the need for additional libraries that perform similar
                tasks and instead work with the standard functionality provided by EF Core 7.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                EF Core 7 also offers faster performance, with improvements to the SaveChanges method. Custom Database
                First templates, using T4 templates, have also been introduced, allowing for greater flexibility in the
                design of the database.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another notable feature in EF Core 7 is the added support for stored procedure mapping for insert,
                update, and delete operations. This allows for more granular control over how data is modified in the
                database.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, EF Core 7 includes new and improved interceptors and events, providing more opportunities for
                developers to add custom logic and behavior to their applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, EF Core 7 is a significant upgrade from its predecessor and offers a wide range of new and
                improved features for developers to take advantage of. It's a must-have for anyone working with .NET and
                databases.

            <p>
                In my experience as a .NET developer, one of the most important considerations when working with Entity
                Framework Core (EF Core) is the number of transactions and roundtrips that occur when inserting or
                updating data in the database. With the release of EF Core 7, this has become even more important, as
                the framework has introduced new optimizations to reduce the number of roundtrips and transactions that
                occur.
            </p>

            <p>
                One such optimization is the removal of transactions when only a single statement is involved. In EF
                Core 6, every SQL statement was wrapped in a transaction, which resulted in additional roundtrips to the
                database. However, in EF Core 7, the framework recognizes that many databases guarantee transactionality
                for single SQL statements and will remove the transaction in these cases.
            </p>

            <p>
                To demonstrate the impact of this optimization, I benchmarked the performance of the same code using
                both EF Core 6 and 7. The results showed a 25% improvement in performance with EF Core 7, thanks to the
                reduction in roundtrips.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's worth noting that these benchmarks were run against a SQL Server instance running on my local
                machine, but it's important to keep in mind that when benchmarking, one should generally never do when
                benchmarking. In a production environment, the latency of the database will play an important role in
                the overall performance of the application, and therefore, it's important to benchmark on a similar
                environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, the optimizations introduced in EF Core 7 are a welcome addition for .NET developers. The
                reduction in transactions and roundtrips can result in significant performance improvements, especially
                in scenarios where a single statement is involved
            </p>

                    Migration to .NET 7

            <p>
                Migrating from .NET 6 to 7 requires upgrading to Visual Studio Code 2022 and updating the .NET Core SDK
                version in the global.json file. For example, if your global.json file currently has this line:
                "version": "6.0.200" it should be updated to: "version": "7.0.100".
            </p>

            <p>
                The next step is to update the Target Framework (TFM) to .NET 7.0 in the project file. For example, if
                your project file currently has this line:
                <code>
                    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
                </code>
                , it should be updated to:
                <code>
                    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
                </code>
                .
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, you will need to update all package references in the project file to version 7.*.* or later.
                For example, if your project file currently has this line:
                <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch" Version="6.0.0"/>
                , it should be updated to:
                <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch" Version="7.0.1"/>
                .
                This applies to all references to Microsoft.AspNetCore., Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.,
                Microsoft.Extensions.*, and System.Net.Http.Json packages.

                It's important to be aware that during the migration process, you may encounter package breaking changes
                and breaking changes in the new version of .NET that may require additional work. This might include
                rewriting certain parts of the code to address these breaking changes. However, with a thorough testing
                and quality assurance process in place, these challenges can be mitigated and the benefits of upgrading
                to the latest version of .NET can be fully realized.

                Once these steps are completed, your application should be fully migrated to .NET 7 and ready to perform
                its operations.

                Tips and best practices for a smooth migration
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                When migrating from one version of .NET to another, it's important to have a solid plan in place to
                ensure a smooth and successful migration. One of the first steps in this process is to thoroughly assess
                the current codebase and identify any potential issues that may arise during the upgrade. This will help
                you develop a comprehensive plan for the upgrade and minimize any potential delays or complications.
            </p>

            <p>
                A comprehensive plan should include testing and deployment strategies. Before starting the migration
                process, it is important to test the code thoroughly, both before and after the upgrade. This will help
                identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the migration process.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to testing, it's important to use the latest tools and versions of the .NET framework. These
                will have the most up-to-date features and performance improvements, and will help ensure that the
                migration process runs smoothly.

            <p>
                Another important consideration is the potential for breaking changes in the new version of .NET and in
                packages you're using. It's important to be aware of these changes and plan accordingly, which may
                require rewriting certain parts of the code to address these breaking changes.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Before any migration, it is better to check the documentation of <a

                breaking changes</a> and packages breaking changes.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Investing in quality assurance is crucial for a successful migration. It ensures the application is
                stable, secure, and performs well after the migration. Communication with the team and keeping them
                informed of progress is also important, as well as working together to resolve any issues that may
                arise.
            </p>

                    Our Experience
                </h3>
            </div>

            <p>
                In our experience with our client, upgrading their application from an older version of .NET to the
                latest version was a smooth process. The first step was to assess the current codebase and identify any
                potential issues that might arise during the upgrade. We then developed a comprehensive plan for the
                upgrade, including testing and deployment strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The actual upgrade process was relatively
                straightforward, as the majority of the code was able to be seamlessly ported to the new version. We did
                encounter a few areas of the code that required some modification, but these were relatively minor and
                easily resolved.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, the upgrade was completed on time and within budget, and the client is now
                able to take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements in the .NET framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the implementation of the .NET version upgrade, we faced a few challenges, but overall the
                process was successful. One of the biggest challenges we faced was dealing with breaking changes in the
                new version of the framework. These breaking changes often required us to rewrite certain parts of the
                code, which added some additional time and effort to the upgrade process. However, we were able to
                mitigate this by thoroughly testing the code before and after the upgrade, which helped us identify and
                resolve any issues quickly.

                On the other hand, the benefits of upgrading to the latest version of .NET were significant. The
                client's application was able to take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements in
                the framework, which has resulted in a faster, more stable and more secure application. Additionally,
                the client's development team was able to start using new features and capabilities that were not
                available in the previous version of the framework.

                Overall, while the process of upgrading to a new version of .NET can be challenging, the benefits of
                doing so far outweigh the challenges. With a thorough plan in place and a commitment to testing and
                quality, it is possible to successfully upgrade an application to the latest version of the framework,
                while delivering significant benefits to the client.
